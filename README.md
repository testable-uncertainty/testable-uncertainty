It is like in quantum mechanics ... You don't know the state of the object.
Remember The Flash the series, s2e23, when Flash became the two people like a quantum particle?...
Quantum logic is applicable to macroobjects, it is useful, it is possible...
So that is application of these principles. 
Let people be objects with hidden values...

Game theory has changed the minds of people. It showed that it is not only zero-sum games,
the life is more complex, the sum of the game can be positive. This simple principle has changed minds and the world.

It is for systems based on people. Our organisations are not reliable. 
Our thought about organisations is very simplified.
Organisations are not reliable, they can be dangerous, and sometimes very dangerous.

All previous solutions were based on one state of the human unit.

One of the goals: Robust, reliable structures of human organisations. Based on modern knowledge, technology, safe for many.

How would you play the chess game, if you don't know what are the figures on the board? 
What will be your strategy? What solutions will you use?
